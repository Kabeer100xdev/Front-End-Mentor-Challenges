# Frontend Mentor Projects 🚀

This repository contains all the frontend challenges I solve from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).  
I'm using these projects to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript while also learning to write clean, maintainable code.

## 💼 Live Projects

Here are some of the challenges I’ve completed:

1. **[Blog Product Card](https://meek-zuccutto-9901d3.netlify.app/)**  
   A simple responsive card with a QR code and some text.

2. **[FAQ ccordion](https://preeminent-palmier-cd5ba6.netlify.app/)**  
   A dark-themed card layout challenge focused on flexbox/grid.

3. **[Profile](https://stalwart-cocada-472def.netlify.app/)**  
   A clean profile card built with Tailwind, practicing spacing and alignment.
